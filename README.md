# Leaf Disease Detection using Deep Learning

# Overview

This project aims to develop a robust deep learning model for the detection and classification of plant leaf diseases. Plant diseases can significantly impact crop yield, and early detection is crucial for effective disease management. Leveraging deep learning techniques, this project automates the process of identifying diseases in plant leaves, providing a timely and accurate solution for farmers and agriculture enthusiasts.

# Features

Deep Learning Model: Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning architecture (e.g., convolutional neural networks) for accurate disease detection.

Multi-Class Classification: Capable of classifying leaves into multiple disease categories, enabling a more comprehensive diagnosis.

Web Interface: An interactive web interface for users to upload leaf images and receive instant disease predictions.

Training Pipeline: Well-documented training pipeline for users to retrain the model on their custom datasets.

# Dataset
The model is trained on a diverse dataset containing images of plant leaves affected by various diseases. The dataset is sourced from reputable agricultural databases and is made available for reference and further research.

# Requirements
Python 3.x

TensorFlow

Flask (for the web interface)

## Model Details
The leaf disease detection model is built using deep learning techniques, and it uses transfer learning to leverage the pre-trained knowledge of a base model. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of 33 different types of leaf diseases. For more information about the architecture, dataset, and training process, please refer to the code and documentation provided.
